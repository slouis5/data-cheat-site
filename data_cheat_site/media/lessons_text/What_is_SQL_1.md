### 1. **Data**:
Data refers to a set of values, often numerical or categorical, that represent information collected in a study or experiment.

**Example**: The heights of 10 students in a class (in cm):  
[ 150, 160, 145, 170, 155, 160, 165, 158, 172, 160 ]

### 2. **Variables**:
Variables represent the attributes or characteristics that are being measured in a study.

**Example**: In the case of the heights of students, the **variable** is **height**. It is the characteristic being measured.

### 3. **Observational Units**:
Observational units refer to the individual entities or members from which data are collected. They are often the "subjects" of the study.

**Example**: The **observational units** in this case are the **students** in the class. Each student's height is a measurement from a specific observational unit.

So, putting it all together:  
- **Data**: Heights of students (e.g., 150 cm, 160 cm, etc.)  
- **Variable**: Height (the attribute being measured)  
- **Observational Units**: The students (the subjects from whom the data are collected)
